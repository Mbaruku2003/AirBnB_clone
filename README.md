this project is on the airbnb clone
First step: Write a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.
This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…

Each task is linked and will help you to:

put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel
create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine

A Cmd instance or subclass instance is a line-oriented interpreter framework
a command line interprter is a simple command lie implemented by python
allows users to execute basic commands and receive responses directly via command line interface

		TO START A COMMAND LINE INTERPRETER:
1.navigate  to the project directory in your terminal
2.Run the command interpreter e.g
	python interpreter.py
to exit theinterreter press exit
